Finance Expense Categorizer Microservice

This microservice categorizes descriptions of transaction expenses based on keyword matches. The microservice provides functionality to match 
descriptions based on default categories and also to add custom categories.

Communication Contract

Requesting Data
Your main program must request data from the microservice by using a ZeroMQ REQ socket. The microservice listens for keyword based financial 
transaction expenses and responds with the appropriate category label such as “Utilities” or “Entertainment”. Requests should be sent using 
socket.send_string(description)
•	The “description” can be 1 or more words which describes the financial expense (e.g., “Starbucks North York”)

Example Call (Python):
socket.send_string(“Starbucks North York”)

The microservice binds to a TCP endpoint: socket.bind(“tcp://*:6120”)

Your main program should connect to this socket using the same port and protocol:
socket.connect(“tcp://localhost:6120”)

Receiving Data
The Finance Categorizer Microservice receives a transaction description string, categorizes it using a default keyword dictionary and optional 
categories added by the user, and then sent back the resulting category back to the sender main program.

Example (Python)
response = socket.recv()
print(f”Category for ‘{description}’: {response}”)
